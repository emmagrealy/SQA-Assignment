# Task Estimation

Managing tasks is one of the most important aspects of any project.
While accurate estimates are the basis of sound project planning, there are many techniques in estimation.

For my project I decided to take the Bottom-up estimate approach.
In this case a project or a task is broken into smaller parts until it gets possible to estimate each of them. 
Thus knowing how much time, efforts, resources or money are required for a certain task, it makes it possible to 
summarize all of them and obtain a picture of the whole project estimate.
The technique requires more time to estimate, but it gives the very accurate results and that is why I felt it was an appropriate approach.
