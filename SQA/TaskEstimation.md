# Task Estimation

Managing tasks is one of the most important aspects of any project.
While accurate estimates are the basis of sound project planning, there are many techniques in estimation.

For my project I decided to take the Bottom-up estimate approach.
In this case a project or a task is broken into smaller parts until it gets possible to estimate each of them.
It involves the estimation of work at the lowest possible level of detail.  
These estimates are then aggregated in order to arrive at summary totals. 
Thus knowing how much time, efforts, resources or money are required for a certain task, it makes it possible to 
summarize all of them and obtain a picture of the whole project estimate.
By building detailed cost and time estimates for a work package, the probability of being able to meet the estimated amounts improves substantially.
The technique requires more time to estimate, but it gives the very accurate results and that is why I felt it was an appropriate approach.

Five steps to successful bottom-up estimating:

1. Identify All Project Required Tasks
2. Estimate All Tasks Identified in Your WBS or Project Activity Definition
3. Identify Task Dependencies
4. Identify the Resources Required to Complete All Tasks
5. Determine When Resources Should Complete These Tasks



Becuase this was an individual assignment, I would have to trust my own estimations and create my own criteria.
I did this by basing my estimations off the complexity of the code associated with each task.

Criteria:

1. Do I have good enough experience with this type of code? 
2. Do I need to do research?
3. Does this task have methods?
4. Do these methods have return types?
5. Does this task include an if statement or a loop?
6. Does this task require a test? 
7. Does any task invlove iterating through a list to retrieve information?
8. Does it include a 2nd method?
9. Does it require the creation of objects? 


As I am using a bottom up approach I did not apply points to tasks as such, however the more times a questions was answered 
with "yes" meant to me, that the difficulty of the task grew (Except the experience Q). 
I wanted to try keep each task as small as I coudl to ensure it was done correctly. 
This meant I tried to break every task down to try answer 4 or less of the above criteria questions.

# Tasks

## Initial tasks required

* **Create a Survey class** - create a survey 
* **Create a Questions class** - create a question
* **Get a list of all surveys** - iterating through a list to retrieve info
* **Get survey by name** - iterating through a list to retrieve info
* **Create Survey Response class** - create a survey response
* **Add an answer to a Survey Response** - create an answer method
* **Get all responses associated with a Survey** - iterating through a list to retrieve info
* **Calculate avergae deviation of a Survey** - create a method, iterate through a list to retrieve info, need to research
* **Calculate standard deviation of a Survey** - create a method, iterate through a list to retrieve info, need to research
* **Get the minimum score of a Survey** - create a method, iterate through a list to retrieve info, need to research
* **Get the maximum score of a Survey** - create a method, iterate through a list to retrieve info, need to research
