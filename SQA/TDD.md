# Test-Driven Development
Test-driven development is a software development process it relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: 
The project requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is created and improved so that the tests pass.

Test-driven development (TDD) approach firstly a test is developed, it specifies and validates what the code in the project will do. 
In simple terms, test cases are created BEFORE code is written. The purpose of TDD is to make the code simpler, clearer and bug-free.

The concept of TDD is very simple. We are supposed to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). 
This approach helps to avoid duplication of code as we continually write a small amount of code at a time in order to pass tests. 
(Tests are nothing but requirement conditions that must be tested to fulfill them).
