* **Fast develop/test cycle:** Launches from within the workbench like JUnit test runs can directly be analyzed for code coverage.
* **Rich coverage analysis:** Coverage results are immediately summarized and highlighted in the Java source code editors.
* **Non-invasive:** EclEmma does not require modifying your projects or performing any other setup.
