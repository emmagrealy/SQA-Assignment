# SQA-Assignment

The assignment is used to highlight the use of gitflow and testing in development. The assignment includes developing a software component that stores information about surveys and the responses to the questions in these surveys.

The project will be done in java and it will also have no interface or external storage. It only contains a controller class with methods that support various features related to the survey application. I will use JUnit testing to test if the code is correct. I used a test-driven approach when creating this project.
